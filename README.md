# Skyscraper Puzzle Solver

## Description
This project implements a solver for the **Skyscraper Puzzle**, a logical puzzle where players must arrange numbers on a grid to satisfy specific constraints. The solution is built using **backtracking** and **Most Restricting Variable (MRV)** algorithms. A graphical interface is provided for users to input the puzzle constraints and view the solution.

## Features
1. Solve 6x6 Skyscraper puzzles using:
   - Backtracking algorithm.
   - MRV heuristic for optimization.
2. Ensure compliance with all puzzle constraints:
   - Each number (1â€“6) appears exactly once in each row and column.
   - Visibility constraints are met from all directions.
3. Graphical User Interface (GUI) for input and visualization.
